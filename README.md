
# CI/CD for Bloglist App

A basic CI/CD implementation for the Bloglist app created for University of Helsinki's Full Stack Open course.

---

It is the same application as the bloglist backend and frontend listed in the [main repository](https://github.com/ndeamador/FullStackOpen2020) of the course, and it was originally developed with the main goals of applying thorough testing (Jest and Cypress) as well as user administration.

The application was cloned to a separate repository exclusively to implement a basic CI/CD to a previously developed project.

The main project for the CI/CD section is [full-stack-open-pokedex](https://github.com/ndeamador/full-stack-open-pokedex).
